    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight,
interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming
 language with first-class functions. While it is most
 well-known as the scripting language for Web pages,
  many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js,
   Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
    multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
